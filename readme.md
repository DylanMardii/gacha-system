# Javascript Gacha System

Source code for gacha system with entirely customizable drop rate for each item.

## How To Use

1. Create a `itemList` variable that contain your items' data and drop rate. You could see the sample on the `index.js` file. Make sure you assign the drop rate on the `rate` property and the item data on the `data` property.
2. Call the function `gacha` with the item list on the first parameter. It should look something like: `gacha(itemList)`.
